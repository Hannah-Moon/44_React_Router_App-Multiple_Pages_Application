# GLAB 320H.8.1 - React Router App

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, learners will be able to:

- Create a "multi-page" React application using BrowserRouter.
- Fetch and handle data from an external API in React.

## Using React Router

We will be creating a "multi-page" application that displays the prices for common crypto-currencies.

To get started, create a new React app within a project folder, as follows:

1. Run command `npx create-react-app cryptoprices`.
2. `cd` into the `cryptoprices` folder.
3. Run `npm install react-router-dom`; this is the package that will facilitate our route creation.
4. Delete the contents of the `src` folder and add blank files for `index.js`, `App.js`, and `style.css`.
5. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
